GitHub version of WCSTools for Mathematica

WCSTools

WCSTools is a Mathematica package to display astronomical FITS images together with WCS 
coordinate grids. The functions in WCSTools are mostly ported from the respective routines 
in the IDL astrolib library. All credits therefore go to the original authors W. Landsman 
and R. Balsano.

The rountines in astrolib support 26 possible map projections. So far I did not managed to 
implement them all. Especially the cubic map projections have been left out for the moment. 
The details of the various projections have been presented in a series of papers from Greisen, 
E.W. & Calabretta, M.R.. You can download the papers from the following web page:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/ . If you are 
in desperate need of any of the not yet supported map projections, contact me and I will 
implement them.

The tool can also be downloaded from my webpage:
